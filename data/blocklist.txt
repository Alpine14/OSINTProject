# OSINT Collector Blocklist
# One term per line. Lines starting with # are comments.
# These terms will cause posts to be filtered out.
#
# IMPORTANT: Add racial slurs, explicit terms, and other content
# you want to exclude from your dataset here.
#
# This file is intentionally sparse - you should populate it
# based on your specific filtering needs.

# Resources for blocklists:

# Example format:

# TODO: Add your blocklist terms here
# For safety, we don't include actual slurs in this template.
# You should download a comprehensive list or build your own.
